Below are the detailed steps a user should follow to run your project. You can use this for your README file:
--------
## **Steps to Run the Project**

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### **1. Clone the Repository**
- Open a terminal and run the following command:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/webapp-project.git
  ```
- Navigate to the project directory:
  ```bash
  cd webapp-project
  ```

---

### **2. Install Dependencies**
- Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) installed.
- Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

---

### **3. Set Up the Database**
1. Open your MySQL server and log in to your MySQL client.
2. Create a database named `app`:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE app;
   ```
3. Create a `users` table in the `app` database:
   ```sql
   USE app;
   CREATE TABLE users (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
       password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
   );
   ```
4. Update the database credentials in `server.js`:
   ```javascript
   const db = mysql.createConnection({
       host: 'localhost',
       user: 'your-username', // Replace with your MySQL username
       password: 'your-password', // Replace with your MySQL password
       database: 'app'
   });
   ```

---

### **4. Start the Server**
- Run the following command to start the server:
  ```bash
  node server.js
  ```
- If the server starts successfully, youâ€™ll see:
  ```
  Server started on http://localhost:3000
  MySQL Connected...
  ```

---

### **5. Access the Application**
- Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
- You can interact with the application:
  - **Signup**: Create a new account.
  - **Login**: Log in with the registered account.

---

### **6. Test the Project**
- Test the signup functionality:
  - Fill in the form on the signup page and submit.
  - Check your MySQL database to confirm the data is stored in the `users` table.
- Test the login functionality:
  - Use the registered email and password to log in.
  - Ensure appropriate feedback (success or error) is displayed.

---

### **7. Notes**
- If you encounter errors:
  - Check the terminal output for any issues.
  - Ensure your MySQL server is running and the credentials in `server.js` are correct.
  - Verify the `users` table exists in the `app` database.
